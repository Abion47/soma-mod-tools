# soma-mod-tools package

Atom plugin to aid with developing mods for SOMA.
This plugin provides syntax coloring for the angelscript code files, and will
also correctly apply syntax coloring to the various xml resources.

Note:
This project is currently is using a fork of symbols-view (https://github.com/atom/symbols-view)
which makes it incompatible with symbols-view and atom-ctags packages. This is a temporary
workaround until the provider service is finished for symbols-view.
